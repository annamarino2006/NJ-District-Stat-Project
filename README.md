# Analyzing how Abseneeism, Grades Offered, and Reading Scores can be Pointed Back to School Funding per Student
We are analyzing New Jersey school districts  by using our statistical skills.
The data I used for my project are both qualitative and quantitative data, and some examples include: absenteeism, grades offered, students' reading scores, and school funding per student. I gathered my based on which websites gave me more information and data that I could utilize for our project (databases, graphs, records, reports, excel sheets, datasets). With attendancce being one of the most crucial essentials to potentially ensure a student's succeess -- not to mention how it is a right to obtain an education -- I think it is important to know how each NJ district handles absenteeism per grade level and how it affects their reading performances and how school funding plays a role in a student's education. I picked systematic sampling because I am analyzing 600 high school districts – which is a large amount – and reduced the difficulty of selecting only one sample without creating any biased data or overlap. 

# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "sta215-marino.R" file, which has available the code of my research. In order to take a look at my dataset, click on the "data.csv" file.

# Data
My end goal for this analysis is to determine if absenteeism and academic grade levels can be correlate with reading performances in New Jersey high school districts, in addition to how school funding plays a role as well. I wanted to investigate how attendance issues would potentially have an effect of students' standarized reading scores. By analyzing the graphs and plots I was able to see wehther or not there was a correlation among my variables.

# Operationalization
The concept of absenteeism was operationalized based on listing all the grade levels and determining whether or not there was an issue for students in NJ districts to be missing school.

I categorized abenteeism into two groups: problematic and non-problematic. I specifically went into dept by impleying that it is considered "problematic" if a student missing more than 15 days of school. In my descriptive table I noticed how grades K-5 are most affected in the future if they continuously miss school, with a 20% chance. The grade levels offered by almost every district (depending on school funding) includes K-5, K-6, K-7, K-8, K-12, 6-12, 7-12, and 9-12. I treated this variable as a nominal variable because they represented specific groups rather than numerical values. On the other hand, my scatter plot demonstrated that students that scored between a 45 and 60 on their reading score had an approximate funding level of $2,000 per student. However, the relationship between scores and funding levels was not statistically significant given the p-value of 0.4996. My data also showed that while schools with more funding had their reading scores scattered all across the graph, the results appeared inconclusive, suggesting that there was no reliable evidence of a relationship between funding and reading performances.

School funding was measured in US dollars and the appromiate amount of money annually that is spent per student.
 
I measured Reading scores based on percentages.

Finally, I came to the conclusion that my effect is statistically correlational, meaning that there is a potential association between variables, but it does not prove causation.
