# NJ-District-Stat-Project
We are analyzing New Jersey school districts by using our statistical skills.
The data I used for my project are both qualitative and quantitative data, and some examples include: reading scores, student-teacher ratio, teacher's average annual salary, and grades offered. We gathered our data as a group based on which websites gave us more information and data that we could utilize for our project. I used random sampling to pick my data, and I have a total of 13 variables.
